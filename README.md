# Assignment2
Using Java’s Generics framework, make two classes… one that stores 2 items of any given type (Pair)
and one that stores 3 items of any given type (Triple). Then use the triple value class to store the win
&amp; loss records of multiple football teams (or any sport) in an array. Next loop through array and
calculate the winning percentage of each team and add team name and win % to a pair class, and
then add that instance to another array. Finally print out all team entries in the pair array with their
win percentages and state which team has the greatest win percentage.
